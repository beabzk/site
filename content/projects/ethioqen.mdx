## Installation

```bash
pip install ethioqen
```

## Quick Start

```python
from ethioqen import EthiopianDate, GregorianDate

# Convert Gregorian to Ethiopian
gregorian = GregorianDate(2024, 9, 10)
ethiopian = gregorian.to_ethiopian()
print(f"Ethiopian date: {ethiopian}")  # Ethiopian date: 2017-01-01

# Convert Ethiopian to Gregorian
ethiopian = EthiopianDate(2017, 1, 1)
gregorian = ethiopian.to_gregorian()
print(f"Gregorian date: {gregorian}")  # Gregorian date: 2024-09-10
```

## Command Line Usage

The package includes a comprehensive CLI for quick conversions:

```bash
# Convert current date to Ethiopian
ethioqen today

# Convert specific Gregorian date
ethioqen convert --from gregorian --date 2024-09-10

# Convert Ethiopian date to Gregorian
ethioqen convert --from ethiopian --date 2017-01-01

# Get help
ethioqen --help
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Use the `--format` flag to customize the output format for your specific
  needs.
</Callout>

## Features

### Accurate Calendar Conversion

The package implements the precise mathematical algorithms for converting between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendar systems, accounting for leap years and calendar differences.

### CLI Interface

A comprehensive command-line interface makes it easy to perform quick conversions without writing code.

### Localization Support

Full support for Ethiopian month names and date formatting in both Amharic and English.

```python
# Example with localization
from ethioqen import EthiopianDate

date = EthiopianDate(2017, 1, 1)
print(date.format('amharic'))  # መስከረም ፩ ቀን ፪ሺ፲፯ ዓ.ም
print(date.format('english'))  # Meskerem 1, 2017 E.C.
```

## Technical Implementation

The conversion algorithms are based on the Julian Day Number system, ensuring accuracy across all date ranges. The package handles edge cases like leap years and provides comprehensive error handling.

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Note">
  Always validate input dates to ensure they fall within supported ranges for
  accurate conversion.
</Callout>
